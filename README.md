# cst336_project

Final team project by

Title: Green House
Description: A web application where users can go to share information about their plants and perhaps, take a leaf from someone else’s book. Users will have information like their USDA Hardiness Zone and their collection of plants, with notes and images attached to each one, stored on their account. They will be able to easily track and update variables like watering frequency, soil used, temperature, light exposure, and fertilization for each plant in their collection. They will be able to promote this information on a centralized forum to either share their success stories or to request advice or diagnosis from other plant owners. Additionally, users will be able to search for plants in their collection among other users’ collections as a means to self-advise. Additional features could be added, if time permits, to gameify the experience. Adding titles and badges for top contributors (sage advisors) or those successful in keeping all of their plants in a continuously thriving state.

Roles: We decided to implement agile workplace philosophy for this small project, therefore our squad has a great deal of autonomy. Each member of the squad will have end-to-end responsibility for specific tasks and outcomes of the project, making their own judgements about how to solve specific problems. Holly and Marianna both have experience with databases, API and front-end development, David suggested that he has a great handle on styling and formatting. However, we decided that we will all take our own part in every step of development with following leadership attributions:
Holly -- web developer, back end dev leader (API), scrum master, team coordinator
Marianna -- web developer, database leader (MySQL)
David -- web developer, front end leader (node.js, bootstrap)
